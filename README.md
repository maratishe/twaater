This is a Chrome Extension.  It will install as an icon in your Toolbar (T+W letters as a doodle).  

Now, you should know that Chrome Extensions are dengerous.  If a bad guy wants to do something with your computer, Chrome Extension is a relatively easy way to do it.  This is a warning.  

However, this Chrome Extension is not dangerous.  All it does is it parses your Twitter search page and aggregates its media (photos and videos) in a slider on the right side. 

### The why

I am tired of having to open each tweet to see what's in it.  I would like someone to parse content and present me with images and videos.  I would like the software to remove all duplicates as well. 
This software does just that!

### How to use

(1) Download the ZIP of this package, and unpack
(2) Chrome > Settings > Extensions,  set "Developer Mode" ON
(3) Install new extension fom the ZIP file by pointing to the folder. 
      - Developer Mode makes it possible

(4) In Twitter, search for some #hashtag, and click ALL at the top of the page
      -- ALL will notify on the new messages, which my extension will open at 20s interval

That's it. In about 20s you will see first media in a slider on the right side. You can open and close it using its handler that says "summary". 
The software will work and part content continuously.
